I'm a passionate software engineering student at Univates campus with a love for open source projects. I'm always looking for new ways to contribute to the community and make a positive impact. My expertise lies in PHP, TypeScript, and Linux, and I'm always eager to learn more. With a focus on empowering Linux with software and creating innovative solutions, I'm driven to make a difference.

If you're looking for a motivated and talented individual to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out to me! You can connect with me on LinkedIn, or visit my website to learn more about my work. And if you like what I do and want to support my efforts, you can buy me a coffee on Ko-fi. Let's work together to make the world a better place, one line of code at a time.

## About Me
I'm a lifelong learner and love tackling new challenges. I've gained experience working with several technologies, including:

- **PHP**: I'm experienced with PHP development and technologies like Composer and Zend/Laminas
-  **JavaScript/TypeScript**: I have a strong understanding of web development and have worked with both front-end and back-end technologies such as React, Node.js, and Express.
-  **Java**: I have skills in developing Java applications, both desktop and mobile.
-  **C/C++**: I'm still learning C/C++ but I already enjoy working on low-level programming projects.
-  **Linux**: I'm comfortable using and working with Linux-based systems, and I'm always looking for ways to improve Linux's accessibility through software development.

In my free time, I love contributing to open-source projects and exploring new technologies. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me playing guitar, playing video games, or spending time with friends and family.
